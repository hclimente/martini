Description: martini deals with the low power inherent to GWAS studies by using 
    prior knowledge represented as a network. SNPs are the vertices of the 
    network, and the edges represent biological relationships between them 
    (genomic adjacency, belonging to the same gene, physical interaction between
    protein products). The network is scanned using SConES, which looks for 
    groups of SNPs maximally associated with the phenotype, that form a close 
    subnetwork.
